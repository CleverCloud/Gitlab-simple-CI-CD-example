# 💡☁️ Deploy from GitLab to Clever Cloud

This project contains a collection of scripts to deploy from GitLab to [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com).

To try it, add the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file example in the folders at the root of your project. Every forlder contains a README with explanations.

⚠️ You can only have one `.gitlab-ci.yml` in GitLab, you can combine scripts or remove them to customize your pipeline.

## 🦊 Use GitLab components

Alternatively, you can use [Clever Cloud GitLab components](https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/CleverCloud/clever-cloud-pipeline) from the catalog, and even import them in your self-hosted GitLab instance.
